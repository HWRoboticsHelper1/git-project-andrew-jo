initializeRepo:
Call initializeRepo() to create the basic infrastructure for a git project. It'll create a git directory and populate it with an objects directory, index file, and HEAD file if those directories/files don't exist. Otherwise, it'll leave them as is. If the initialization adds anything, it'll let you know the repo has been successfully created. If you started with all of that infrastructure, it'll let you know the repo already exists.
